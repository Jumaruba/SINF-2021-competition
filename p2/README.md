## Meeting to capture Charizardius

## <Statment>
Some pokemon are really hard to capture and sometimes big teams are created to make this possible. That's the case of *Charizardizius*: your next target.  

To make this operation practicable, a meeting needs to be scheduled, so that a whole strategy can be discussed.   
 For a specific day, you have asked the members to give you a **list of time intervals of which the members are not available** so that you can choose a meeting timeframe with no absences.   
You have decided to merge the overlapping time ranges, so that you could visualize better the available timeframes.  
In the end, how many timeframes will the final schedule have?  

## Input format
The first line contains the number **N** of intervals given.  
The following **N** lines contains a pair of integers separated by space indicating the **Sm**, the start minute, and the **Em**, the ending minute of the interval.  

## Constraints
- `1 <= N <= 10^4`
- `0 <= Si <= Si <= 10^4`  

## Output format
The output should be a single integer representing the number of time ranges after the merge operation.
